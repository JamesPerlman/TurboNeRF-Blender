### Installation Instructions ###

Hello, alpha tester!  Thank you for your interest in this project.  Currently we are in the extremely early stages of development still, but there are a ton of new features coming soon, so please check back soon.  If you'd like to be a part of the official alpha tester discord, please send an email to james at jperl dot net, and tell me a bit about yourself and what you'd like to do with NeRF.  

This addon requires you to download the [PyTurboNeRF](https://github.com/JamesPerlman/TurboNeRF/releases/tag/pre-release) binary that goes along with your supported NVIDIA GPU.  

Happy testing!
