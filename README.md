## ðŸš§ UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT ðŸš§

Hello, fellow NeRF enthusiast! I'm James. I'm working on building some tools so I can make NeRF art, and lucky for you they are all open-source!  

Previously this repo loaded the python bindings from [instant-ngp](https://github.com/NVLabs/instant-ngp) to perform rendering inside Blender.  For a while this was just a pet project and it was fun to evaluate instant-ngp for artistic uses, however now I have made this my life goal and so I have decided to create my own NeRF rendering engine based on the more permissively-licensed [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVLabs/tiny-cuda-nn) and plenty of public NeRF research.

The new repo for the hardcore rendering components is located at [JamesPerlman/NeRFRenderCore](https://github.com/JamesPerlman/NeRFRenderCore).  This repo (turbo_nerf) will be used as the Blender addon codebase, and will be undergoing a full makeover to prepare for a release.

Please do not try to install this blender addon right now, it is completely broken!
