## ⚠️ IN OPEN ALPHA! ⚠️  

Hello, fellow NeRF enthusiast! I'm James. I'm working on building some tools so I can make NeRF art, and lucky for you they are all open-source!  

This repo is now in open alpha! To learn how to run this project on your own computer, check out this video:  https://youtu.be/TeWYAbhgaiU  

Lots of new features are coming soon, and I can't wait to show you all what they are!
